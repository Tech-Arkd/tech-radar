Nodejs > 14,adopt,Frontend,FALSE,"JS Engine, defacto"
Nodejs <= 12,hold,Frontend,FALSE,Older JS Engine. We should replace it with latest LTS version (14 or 16).
React,hold,Frontend,FALSE,Popular JS library. We hold this library because it was hard to maintain in previous projects. Hard also to find someone capable of coding React properly

PHP,adopt,Backend,FALSE,Our backend main engine
Lumen,adopt,Backend,FALSE,Our containerized framework
Open API Swagger,adopt,Backend,FALSE,Swagger for documented api
Webpack,adopt,Backend,FALSE,Popular packager. A simple configurable packager that's still used widely. In the future we may all move to Rollup.
Rollup,adopt,Backend,new,"Faster packager. Vite.js is using Rollup, thus the direction for Vue programmer will be using Rollup. Based on our experience, Rollup is a lot faster than Webpack"
Parcel,hold,Backend,new,Hold because of inconsistent result (can't be used in webpack). We now use Rollup.
Vite.js,adopt,Backend,new,New Vue packager. It's replacing vue-cli. Built on top of Rollup.

lerna,hold,Backend,FALSE,"Multi repo package manager, hold because of no update. Its role is being replace by NPM workspaces"
NPM workspaces,assess,Backend,new,NPM official multi repo package manager. We can use it to build multiple project at once. It may be useful for tightly dependent libraries but managed in different projects
Dart,adopt,Mobile,TRUE,Agnostic and modular state management
vuex,adopt,Mobile,FALSE,State management for Vue. It's used to share states/variables across components
IONIC,hold,Mobile,FALSE,Old-school coding.

window.fetch,adopt,Mobile,TRUE,Native XMLHttpRequest api support that behaves similar to axios or other common XMLHttpRequest libraries
Blue Pattern Library - Collaborative Components,assess,Mobile,FALSE,DLS library published as individual components. It follow bit.dev paradigm
Blue Icon,adopt,Mobile,FALSE,Blue standard icons. All icons are provided through this library
Polyfill.io using polyfill-io-feature-detection,adopt,Mobile,FALSE,"Dynamic polyfill library to support older browser. We can use this to have polyfill for older browser, rather than transpiling it to older version ES"
date-format-lite,adopt,Mobile,FALSE,Lightweight date formatter and manipulator. It's only 3 KB and able to format dates properly.
AWS S3,adopt,Infrastructure,FALSE,S3 for static contents. Assets are stored here. We use GCS to support faster delivery and seamless ui version upgrade
docker / docker-cli,adopt,Infrastructure,FALSE,Container management standard. This is the most widely used container management. We use atleast docker-cli to code our build script
NGINX,adopt,Infrastructure,FALSE,"Default UI server. We use a lightweight http-server to serve our static content. We do some routing, rate-limiting and other simple logic here also using openresty and sub_filter plugin"
Window event messaging,adopt,Infrastructure,FALSE,Use window custom event to communicate across components from different repo or inside iframe. The best example is address-module library
Lazy-load / Lazy-rendering,adopt,Infrastructure,FALSE,Only load or render inside viewport content. Do not load everything at once. Use Observer pattern to detect location in viewport
podman,assess,Infrastructure,new,"Free Container management. This is popular alternative of docker in Mac. Having some problem with pushing large image library to dockerhub, may get hold"
Rancher Desktop,assess,Infrastructure,new,Docker desktop replacement. Still ongoing to test it all through. The best thing is that it supports docker-cli.
Web Canary Release,trial,Infrastructure,TRUE,Safe release to only internal user. We route request to 'newest' version only for internal
Docker desktop,hold,Infrastructure,FALSE,Container management UI and dashboard. This is the UI of docker.
Global Variable in Micro FE,hold,Infrastructure,FALSE,"Avoid using shared global variable, hard to maintain. We can not really sure if the global variable is not used in other collab."
FE Unit test,hold,Infrastructure,FALSE,Unit test in Frontend can not really shows changes and backward compatibility (integrity) of our UI. It should be replaced by UI Integration Test
FE Integration test,adopt,Infrastructure,new,Provides snapshots and integrity checking for our UI. It shows before and after for every changes to review properly
Modern JS Output for Modern browser (ES6+),assess,Infrastructure,new,Output adaptive output when building codes. It will most probably use ES6+ standards when possible and falback to ES2005 when not possible.
